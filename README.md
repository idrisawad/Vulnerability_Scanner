# Vulnerability_Scanner #

This script is a vulnerability scanner written in Python. It is designed to scan a given target URL or list of URLs and check for various types of vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, outdated components, brute force vulnerabilities and WAF bypass vulnerabilities. It also verifies exploitability and logs all positive results in a log.csv file.

### The script has the ability to perform the following tasks: ###

**Multi-threading:** The script utilizes multi-threading to scan multiple targets simultaneously, reducing the overall time required for the scan.

**Fingerprinting:** The script sends a request to the target and parses the HTML to gather information about the server and the title of the page. This information can be used to identify the web application and its version, which can be useful in identifying vulnerabilities.

**Exploit verification:** The script checks for and verifies exploitability of vulnerabilities. It sends a request to the target with a payload that is known to exploit a specific vulnerability and checks the response for a successful exploitation.

**SQL injection vulnerability scanning:** The script sends a request to the target with a payload that is known to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. It checks the response for indications of a successful exploitation.

**Outdated component vulnerability scanning:** The script sends a request to the target with a payload that is known to exploit outdated component vulnerabilities. It checks the response for indications of a successful exploitation.

**Bruteforce vulnerability scanning:** The script sends a request to the target with a payload that is known to exploit brute-force vulnerabilities. It checks the response for indications of a successful exploitation.

**WAF Bypass:** The script uses HTTP parameter pollution technique to bypass web application firewalls. It sends multiple requests with different payloads to check if the firewall can be bypassed.

**GUI:** The script uses tkinter library to create a GUI that shows running scans on the top, and positive results on the sides

**Logging:** The script logs all positive results in a log.csv file, which includes the target, vulnerability and exploitability of the vulnerability.

#### Command line options: ####

 The script allows you to configure the scan using command line options, such as specifying the target URLs and number of threads.

### Prerequisites: ### 

 - Python3
 - requests library
 - BeautifulSoup library
 - argparse library
 - concurrent.futures library

### User Manual: ### 

 1. Install the required libraries by running ```pip install requests bs4 argparse concurrent.futures```
 2. Run the script by using the command ```python3 vulnerability_scanner.py -t [target_urls] -th [number_of_threads]```
 3. The script will scan the target URL(s) and check for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, outdated components, brute force vulnerabilities, WAF bypass vulnerabilities and verifies exploitability.

#### The script will also log all positive results in a log.csv file #####

### Command line options: ###

`-t` or `--targets`: List of target URLs to scan. This option is required.
`-th` or `--threads`: Number of threads to use for the scan. Default is 10.
`-npm` or `--npm_scan`: Enables the scan for npm vulnerabilities.


### Usage: ###

```python3 vulnerability_scanner.py -t https://example.com -th 10```
This command will scan the target URL "https://example.com" using 10 threads

```python vulnerability_scanner.py -t https://example1.com https://example2.com -th 20```
This command will scan the target URLs "https://example1.com" and "https://example2.com" using 20 threads

### Conclusion: ###

This script is a powerful and efficient tool for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications. Its multi-threading, fingerprinting, exploit verification, WAF bypass and logging features make it a valuable addition to any security tester's toolkit. It allows security professionals to quickly and easily identify vulnerabilities in web applications and take appropriate action to protect their systems. This script can also be used in a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and fixed before the application is released to production.

To implement more payloads, you can add them to the payloads list in the relevant functions (`scan_target`, `check_sql_injection`, `check_outdated_components`, `check_brute_force`, `bypass_waf`, `verify_exploit`).

It's important to note that this script is just an Basic code which may require additional adjustments to suit your specific use case, 
and that security testing is a complex task and therefore this script should be just one part of a comprehensive security testing strategy.
